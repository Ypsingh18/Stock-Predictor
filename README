In order to run this project you need to install the following libraries: numpy, scikit-learn, tweepy, textblob, matplotlib

Overview of the project:- The team implemented a website, using Vue, that allows clients to either log in or create an account using facial recognition that runs Microsoft Azure on the backend. Once clients are logged on the website prompts them with options for various possible stock predictions. The user specifies the date and company they would like the stock prediction for, then the backend takes this information to go forth and calculate the stock value for that given day. All stock predictions are made by accessing data stored on Alpha Vantage and by accessing recent tweets that are being posted about a company whether they are primarily positive or negative. This is relayed back to the front end and displayed to the user.
